        Mingwei completed her PhD with Cath Lindon at the University of Cambridge, UK in 2014, studying protein degradation when cells finish division and start to build new daughter cells. \
        She then moved across the pond to the US and did a postdoc with Dan Finley at the Harvard Medical School, where she studied the biochemistry of red blood cell differentiation. \
        Drawn by the fascinating live-cell imaging techniques (as well as the gorgeous Rocky Mountain), she joined Sabrina Spencer’s lab at the University of Colorado-Boulder in 2016, \
        to investigate how cells choose between proliferation and quiescence. <br/><br/>

        In 2020, she became a Principal Investigator in the Center of Cell Lineage and Atlas (CCLA), at Bioland Laboratory, Guangzhou, China.

          Xinyi earned her master degree at Southwest University (Chongqing, China) in 2020. She did her graduate work at the State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, where she \
          focused on unraveling the mechanism of the innate immune signaling - how <i>Drosophila</i> STING (dSTING) activates Relish to mediate antiviral immune response. \
          She joined the Min Lab as a Research Assistant in July 2020. \
          She will learn the state-of-the-art imaging technologies and explore her interests on cell biology. Meanwhile, she is also taking care of the administration work for the group.

          Mengdan completed her PhD at Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health (Chinese Academy of Sciences) in June 2020. \
          Her PhD study was mainly focused on the function of small molecular, such as Vitamin A and Vitamin C, in somatic cells reprogramming, and the role of mesenchymal-to-epithelial (MET) during the cell fate transition.
          For her postdoc work, Mengdan will study the role of cell cycle regulation in reprogramming at the single-cell level.

          An Gong majored in materials science and engeering during his undergraduate study. He was admitted as a master student to Aiguo Wu's biomaterials group at Ningbo Institute of Materials and Technology (Chinese Academy of Sciences) in 2011, \
          where he gained some experience on synthesis of contrast angents for bio-medical imaging. His growing interest on biophysics \
          drove him to <em>research center casear</em> (Bonn, Germany) in 2014. At <em>caesar</em>, he worked on characterizing sperm sensory-motor loop and measuring sperm 3D motility with holography under the supervision of Prof. Benjamin Kaupp and Dr. Luis Alvarez. \
          After finishing his interdisciplinary research training in 2020, he joined the Min Lab as a postdoc.
