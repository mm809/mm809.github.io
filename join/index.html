## Undergraduate/Graduate Students

Undergraduate and graduate students may work with us via joined PhD programmes between Bioland Laboratory and other universities of choice. Please contact <a href="/contact/">Mingwei</a> for details.

## Postdoctoral Fellows

We are interested in a broad range of questions underlying the dynamics of cell fate transitions.
We approach these questions by both wet and dry lab methods and by developing new tools.
We are also open to ideas that youâ€™re excited about. Please send us an email to describe your interest in our lab.
Inquiries about Postdoctoral positions should be emailed directly to <a href="/contact/">Mingwei</a>.

## Other

We are also interested in hosting other visitors who enrich our scientific environment and lab culture. This could include (but is not limited to) foreign exchange students, interns, sabbatical visitors from academia and industry, and post-bac technicians. We are open to other arrangements as well, so please contact us if you are interested in our work.
